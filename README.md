⭐ WTWR (What to Wear?) — Backend API
The WTWR backend provides the server‑side logic for the What to Wear? application. It handles data storage, user authorization, and item management, giving the frontend a secure and reliable API to interact with. This project is built with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB, and follows best practices for validation, error handling, and RESTful design.

🚀 Features
The backend includes:

- User registration and authentication (JWT‑based)
- Secure password hashing
- CRUD operations for clothing items
- Ownership enforcement (only owners can delete their items)
- Like/unlike functionality for items
- Centralized error handling
- Request validation
- MongoDB data modeling with Mongoose
